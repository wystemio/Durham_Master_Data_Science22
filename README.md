EBDS和Strategic Leadership这种文科型作业就是essay，就不上传交的作业了，课程内容就放在这个页面   
IMDS这门课没选，但是既然可以看到课程内容，一起放在这个页面供参考  
其他我选择的课程内容依据课程放到相应文件夹中 
毕业项目刚刚开始  

## PHIL42415_2022 -- Ethics and Bias in Data Science 
*这课虚得很，很不推荐选，选这个不需要选数学，事实上根据同学们的反馈，总体上数学分数比这课高得多*

- Lecture Two - Data, the Environment & Sustainability  
- Lecture Three - Algorithmic Decision-Making & Black Box Reasoning  
- Lecture Four - Privacy, Consent & Personal Data 

## BUSI4S115_2022 -- Strategic Leadership
*另一门水课，总体上比EBDS好点*

## MATH42615_2022 -- Introduction to Mathematics for Data Science
*没选这门课，但是资料放开，所以也一并展示出来*
- Week 1: Basics of vectors  
We will start by looking at how vectors can be used to help us describe various things in the world. This leads to looking at the basic geometry of vectors. Covers lecture videos 1.1 to 3.2

- Week 2: Matrices and linear transformations  
Covers lecture videos 3.3 to 4.3

- Week 3: Probability theory and Calculus  
In this week we will look at the mathematical description of randomness and probability, which is essential in understanding statistics, data, and measurement. Covers lecture videos 5.1 to 7.5

- Week 4: More calculus and applications
