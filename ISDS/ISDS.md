Total Points: 61 / 100

### Question1:

### Question2:
| Exploratory Data Analysis | 7 / 20 | 
| --- | --- | 
| Clear and thorough exploration of the relationships between predictor variables | +5 pts |
| Good supplementary data summaries additional to the scatterplot matrix | +2 pts |

### Question3:
| Modelling | 23 / 35 | 
| --- | --- | 
| Succinct explanation of logistic regression provided | +3 pts |
| Succinct explanation of best subset selection (or why we want to reduce the number of predictors) provided | +3 pts |
| Presentation of coefficients of final fitted logistic regression model | +1 pts |

| Correct calculation of AIC, BIC and an estimate of test error using k-fold cross-validation for the logistic regression models M_0, ..., M_p. | +6 pts |
| Thorough and sensible justification of the choice of k in logistic regression. | +4 pts |
| Presentation of group means in LDA / QDA | +1 pts |
| Sensible comment on group means in LDA / QDA | +2 pts |

### Question4:
| Model Comparison | 8 / 15 |
